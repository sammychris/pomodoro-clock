# Calculator

`Motivation`:
An app created for FreeCodeCamp, While I went through the phase of practising web front-end developement.

## Overview

A simple Pomodoro-clock app that tracks session-time and break-time. Which sets a count-down timer to track both times. This is done by clicking on the big play button displayed on the screen. And both session-timer and break-timer can be adjusted as well using the buttons next to their names.

## Features

- Starts a timer of any session by clicking on the big start button
- Pauses by click on the pause button
- Contains count-down for both session-time and break-time
- Both count-downs can be adjusted
- Increment Session time by click the increment button
- Decrement Session time by click the decrement button
- Increment Break time by click the increment button
- Decrement Break time by click the increment button
- An alarm that beeps at the end of every count-down
